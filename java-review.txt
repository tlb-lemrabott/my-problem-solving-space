* Why Abstract Classes implementing an interface are not abligated to implement the interface functions?
* Why can not create an object from an interface?
* Why abstract class can not be instentiated ?
* Static methods cannot be annotated with @Override. Why ?
* The equal method used with Strings, is inherited from Object or it is in the String class ?
* if two objects are same, they should have the same hasCode.
* pass by value vs pass by reference
* Interfaces define method contracts.
* Specifications define method behaviors. 
* Interfaces for classes are like Specifications for Frameworks
* floor, ceil, roud
* Java has two type of specifications: Standard Edition Specification and Entreprise Specification
* why map doesn't extend the collection interface?
* map does not inherit from Iterable => map does not have forEach 
* HashMap does not allow deplucates key
*why hashmap does not have get key by value in java: HashMap does not have a direct method to find keys by values because the mapping is designed to be accessed by keys.
