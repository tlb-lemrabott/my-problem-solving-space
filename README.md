# 🧠 My Problem Solving Space

Welcome to my personal repository where I solve data structures and algorithms problems using **Java**. This space is dedicated to practicing and improving my problem-solving skills by working on a variety of challenges from platforms like **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and others.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The problems are organized by **topic/folder** based on the main technique or data structure used in the solution:

├── arrays-manipulation/
├── backtracking/
├── bfs/
├── dfs/
├── dynamic-program/
├── graph/
├── hash-map/
├── integer/
├── linkedlist/
├── math-equations/
├── min-heap/
├── object-oriented/
├── searching-algorithms/
├── sliding-window/
├── sorting-algorithms/
├── string-manipulation/
├── tree/
├── trie/



Each folder contains Java solutions to problems related to that specific area of algorithmic thinking or data structure.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Language: **Java**

---

## 🔄 Git Automation Script File

Each problem solution is committed individually using a custom shell script (`git-automation.sh`) that:

- Recursively finds `.java` files
- Extracts the problem name from the filename
- Creates a meaningful commit message per problem

This helps in maintaining clean version history and traceability.

---

## 📌 Goals

- Strengthen data structures and algorithms knowledge
- Prepare for my coding interviews 
- Track my learning and progress in java problem solving over time

---

## 📚 Notes

- This repository is **not** an answer key.
- Solutions reflect my personal understanding and growth.
- Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
